# A short introduction to our website


## What is this site about?
We wanted to create a simple and fun application about Linear Algebra and the basics of it. Our website is ment to help students who struggle with learning algebra, or just help them remember the basics.  
The site we created is user-friendly, so you don't need much time to figure around how it works! You are a click away from filling your brain with freshly information.

## We created 6 interactive pages that can help you complete your jurney:  
* Tutorial
* Examples
* Quiz
* Different Algorithms that were implemented
* Fun facts about math
* About us

## Tools we used  
Well it's not **evrything** but those are the most important: react, npm, babel, webpack

## What inspired us?  
Well to be honest, it is really hard to tell what inspired us in the first point. We started by thinking about building a site that helps the user to learn something, but our passion for math took over and we agreed to do something like this. The key is not to give up, just keep going and you will do it!
