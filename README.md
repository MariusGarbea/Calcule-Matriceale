The app is meant to be used by both current students seeking to get the gist of linear algebra and long time graduates ready to refresh their knowledge.
Being user-friendly, you can jump right in and get your feet wet with some math!

## The app contains 6 interactive pages that can help you complete your journey:
* Tutorial
* Examples
* Quiz
* Calculator based on different algorithms
* Fun facts about math
* About us  

## Tools used
* React (for the logic and UI)
* npm (for managing the packages)
* Webpack (for bundling the app)
* Babel (for compiling ES6 JS)
